                                    The company will seek to provide its
                                    painting services in the most timely manner
                                    and with an ongoing comprehensive
                                    quality-control program to provide 100%
                                    customer satisfaction. The companyâ€™s
                                    principal officers see each contract as an
                                    agreement not between a business and its
                                    customers, but between partners that wish to
                                    create a close and mutually-beneficial
                                    long-term relationship. This will help to
                                    provide greater long-term profits through
                                    referrals and repeat business.
